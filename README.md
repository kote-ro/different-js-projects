# speech-recognition
To start the application you need a **certain version** browser and some IDE plugin, which will start our app in a separate local server (for example WebStorm provides build-in web server).

> [Versions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API#Browser_compatibility) of browsers that support Web Speech API.

How does the application work:
1. Open app in chosen browser
2. Allow microphone
3. Speak and you will see your words in the note module
4. If you say a keyword (like 'mushroom' or 'mushrooms') application will print appropriate emoji (üçÑ)
